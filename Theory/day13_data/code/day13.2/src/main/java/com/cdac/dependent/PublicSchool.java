	 * If we directly write subjectTeacher = new EnglishTeacher(), then the dependent class
	 * (PublicSchool) is creating its own dependency, which leads to tight coupling.
	 * This means whenever the dependency changes (for example, from EnglishTeacher to MathsTeacher),
	 * the dependent class itself must be modified.
	 *
	 * To achieve loose coupling, the dependent class should not create its own dependency.
	 * Instead, a third party (in this case, the tester or framework) should inject the dependency
	 * through the constructor â€” this is called Constructor-Based Dependency Injection.
